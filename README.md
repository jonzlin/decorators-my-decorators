# decorators-my-decorators
Decorators notebook from the 6-22-2017 Boston Python talk. 

Setup
-----
The ipython notebook runs on jupyter hub, which is a handy visual repl. You can get that by doing:

```
pip install jupyter
```

Additionally, in order to show the notebook as slides, the way that I presented it, I used RISE, which you can find here:

I also used dataframes throughout, which you can get by doing:
```
pip install pandas
```

Enjoy!
