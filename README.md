# decorators-my-decorators
Decorators notebook from the 6-22-2017 Boston Python talk. 

Setup
-----
The ipython notebook runs on jupyter hub, which is a handy visual repl. You can get that by doing:

```
pip install jupyter
```

I also used dataframes throughout, which you can get by doing:
```
pip install pandas
```

If you want to mimic the setup I had for slides, I used RISE with the notebook, which you can find here:

Enjoy!
